# CS160 UCSB Fall 2017 Final Project

## Description
The main project we worked on throughout the quarter was building a compiler for a LR(1) object-oriented programming language running on x86 machines. It was separated into 4 parts.

Part 1 - Building a a lexer and parser using Yacc and Lex a parsing and lexing framework  
Part 2 - Augmenting the grammar to construct an abstract syntax tree  
Part 3 - Context sensitive analysis and building a symbol table  
Part 4 - Code generation using the stack machine model

## Building and Running
Only runs on linux not MacOS.  
To build and run type `make run` into terminal in the root directory.  
You can also manually build and run language files using the generated lang executable.
